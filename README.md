# CrossKeys
I'm an avid fan of the game Civ2. As computers keep getting upgraded, it's becoming increasingly difficult to play Civ2 (fortunately, I've always managed to overcome various issues). However, on laptops, keyboard problems can be really annoying. CrossKeys is a small tool that enhances the laptop keyboard. It's designed specifically for the Civ2 game. It uses the four arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to simulate the diagonal keys on the numeric keypad, enabling laptops without a numeric keypad to control Civ2 as well (for Civ2, diagonal keys are essential). I hope this open - source software can help all Civ2 enthusiasts. Just enjoy it!
